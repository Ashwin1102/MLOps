## Changes
- I have updated the data to diabeties and chnaged model to OLS (because now the problem is regression instead of classificaiton). As OLS is in statsmodels package, it has been included in requirements.txt. I have updated the directory name and has made relevent changes in the dockerfile (also updated the python version to 3.11).
